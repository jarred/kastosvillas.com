Kastos is a little island in the Ionian covered in olive trees, some of which are hundreds of years old.

Kastos lies southeast of the island of Lefkada, just below the island of Kalamos. Mainland Greece is about 6 miles away. From the small town of Mytikas on the mainland there are regular daily connections by ferry boat with the island of Kastos.

Just seven kilometers long and less than one kilometer wide Kastos boasts just one village, which bears the island’s name. The little village, built around the harbour is home to the island’s thirty five inhabitants.

There’s no mass tourism, no hotels and very few rentable rooms, the vast majority of tourists are on yachts. There are only a few roads on the island and a handful of vehicles. The island’s west coast is rugged, whilst the east coast has many small beaches, which can be accessed from land or sea. With only a few tavernas and a couple of shops, those looking for shopping malls, internet cafes, bright lights and disco music will be disappointed.

What the island lacks in size, it makes up for in charm. Kastos is off the beaten track, barely touched by tourism and therein lies the appeal of this sleepy island paradise. Worlds away from the fumes and crowds of big cities, Kastos remains unspoiled by the modern world, even in the height of summer you can find a secluded beach to relax on.
